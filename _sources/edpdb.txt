 :mod:`edPDB` --- Simple processing of PDB files
==================================================

The :mod:`edPDB` module contains extensions to the Biopython_
:mod:`Bio.PDB` module that help with editing PDB_ files in preparation
for molecular dynamics simulations.

This module is completely independent from :mod:`gromacs` and
distributed with *GromacsWrapper* as a convenience. As all other code,
it is in a steady state of development and flux...

The :mod:`edPDB` module is distributed under the `Biopython licence`_ .

   :mod:`Bio.PDB` in Biopython_
      :mod:`edPDB` is built on top of the great work done in the Bio.PDB module

      Andrew Dahlke's pdbcat_ tools might also be a useful alternative if you prefer shell to python.
